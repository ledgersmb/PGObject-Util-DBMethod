PGObject-Util-DBMethod

This package provides syntactic sugar which allows for declarative mapping of
stored procedures to supported PGObject paradigms.  It is designed to work 
initially with PGObject::Simple, but will almost certainly be supported with 
PGObject::CompositeType when this is released.

Please see the POD/Man page for detailed information.
